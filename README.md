This is an improved version of [ComfyUI-openpose-editor](https://github.com/huchenlei/ComfyUI-openpose-editor) 
in ComfyUI, enable input and output with flexible choices. Much more convenient and easier to use. It integrates the render function which you also can intall it separately from my [ultimate-openpose-render](https://github.com/westNeighbor/ComfyUI-ultimate-openpose-render) repo or search in the Custom Nodes Manager

If you like the project, please give me a star! ⭐

## Installation

- Manually install (**Recommend**), go to ComfyUI `/custom_nodes` directory
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/westNeighbor/ComfyUI-ultimate-openpose-editor
    cd ./ComfyUI-ultimate-openpose-editor
    pip install -r requirements.txt # if you use portable version, see below
    ```
    if you use portable version, install requirement accordingly, for example, I have portable in my E: disk
    ```bash
    E:/ComfyUI_windows_portable/python_embeded/python.exe -m pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
- You can install through the `Manager -> Custom Nodes Manger` search method, but probably you will meet problem to open the editor cause the **Manager** change the folder name, check the folder name after installation and change the folder name in file **_./js/openpose_editor.js_** in line 110 to the actual folder name in your computer.

    For example, if you have folder name **_westNeighbor_ComfyUI-ultimate-openpose-editor_** after installed, you need to change
    ```bash
    src: "extensions/ComfyUI-ultimate-openpose-editor/ui/OpenposeEditor.html",
    ```
    to
    ```bash
    src: "extensions/westNeighbor_ComfyUI-ultimate-openpose-editor/ui/OpenposeEditor.html",
    ```

- Restart ComfyUI

    </p>

## Features
The node is very functional and rich features to fit all your needs.
- It is totally local running, no internet requiring like the [ComfyUI-openpose-editor](https://github.com/huchenlei/ComfyUI-openpose-editor)
- It can handle all kinds of situations

    - It can go without any input, you can get an empty image or add poses of persons in the editor ui.

    - It can accept POSE\_KEYPOINTS or poses in json format as input.

    - To edit poses, right click the node, and open the editor through `Open in Openpose Editor` menu. The send back poses will be shown in the pose json input area. Be ware that the edit priority is **POSE\_KEYPOINT > POSE\_JSON** 

    - It can output pose images, or POSE\_KEYPOINTS or the json poses. Be ware that the output priority is **POSE\_JSON > POSE\_KEYPOINT**

    - It integrates the render options too, so you can use it as an render node too, or check my [ultimate-openpose-render](https://github.com/westNeighbor/ComfyUI-ultimate-openpose-render) node.
